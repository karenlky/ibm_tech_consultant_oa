ALGO0001. Looking for Size
A shop has some T-shirts available. T-shirt size ranges from 1000XS (1000 'X's before 'S') to 1000XL (1000 'X's before 'L'). The sizes order in (XXXX...XXXS ≤ XS ≤ S ≤ M ≤ L ≤ XL ≤ XXXX...XXXL) from the smallest to the largest.

Customers will come to the shop and request T-shirts of different sizes. The shop can fulfill a request with a T-shirt with an exact size or a larger size. For example, a request of size M can be fulfilled with a T-shirt of size M / L / XL / XXXX...XXXL.
